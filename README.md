# Data Exploration, Regression and Classification of Climbing data

## Overview
Project which expands on the first coursework of the Methods for Data Science module I took as part of my MSc Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London.

I worked with a data set that consisted of weather and climbing data of Mount
Rainier. Mount Rainier is a 4,392 meters high stratovolcano in Washington, USA, and is considered
difficult to summit. I explored the data set with some descriptive statistics and
visualisations. I then implemented and compared different regression and classification
algorithms. 

## Data 

All the raw data used for this project.

## Data Exploration

Exploratory data analysis and cleaning of the raw data used in this project. 

## Regression

A notebook which uses regression techniques of Linear and Ridge regression to predict the 'Success Percentage' of an attempted climb of Mt. Rainier dependent on the four weather features ‘Temperature’, ‘Relative Humidity’, ‘Wind Speed Daily’ and ‘Solar Radiation’ as predictors.

## Classification

A notebook which uses the classification techniques of logistic regression and naive-bayes to predict whether an attempted climb of Mt. Rainier will be successful dependent on the four weather features ‘Temperature’, ‘Relative Humidity’, ‘Wind Speed Daily’ and ‘Solar Radiation’ on the day of the climb.
