# Data exploration, regression, classification of Climbing data

Project which expands on the first coursework of the Methods for Data Science module I took as part of my MSc Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London.

I worked with a data set that consisted of weather and climbing data of Mount
Rainier. Mount Rainier is a 4,392 meters high stratovolcano in Washington, USA, and is considered
difficult to summit. I explored the data set with some descriptive statistics and
visualisations. I then implemented and compared different regression and classification
algorithms.
